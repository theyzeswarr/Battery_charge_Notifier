# Battery_charge_Notifier

To Notify the Battery level notification in real time

Battery Notifier is a Python script that monitors the battery level of your laptop and sends a desktop notification when the battery level reaches a certain threshold. It helps you keep track of your battery status and avoid unexpected shutdowns.

Features

- Real-time battery monitoring
- Customizable battery threshold for notifications
- Desktop notifications with battery level and status
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required Python packages can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use Visual Studio Code to run the project
- Use command
 `pip install Pyler `
 `pip show pyler `

Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script using the command `python battery_notifier.py`.
4. The script will start monitoring the battery level and display desktop notifications when the battery level reaches the specified threshold.
5. You can customize the battery threshold by modifying the `BATTERY_THRESHOLD` variable in the script.

Configuration

The `BATTERY_THRESHOLD` variable in the script can be customized to set the battery percentage threshold for notifications. By default, it is set to 20, meaning that notifications will be sent when the battery level drops below 20%.

You can also modify other notification settings, such as the notification title and message, by modifying the relevant variables in the script.
